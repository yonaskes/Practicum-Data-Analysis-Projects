Data Preprocessing Project

The project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

The report will be considered when building the credit score of a potential customer. The credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

The purpose of this project is to report for a bank's loan division whether the customer's marital status and number of children has an impact on the default on a loan.

The project is going to confirm the following hypotheses:

1. Number of children of employees have impact on paying loan to the bank on time.
2. The effect of marital status in paying loan to the bank on time.
3. When income level of the employees increases they pay loan on time.
4. Identify which loan purposes makes employee not to pay on time.
