Video Game Store Project

Project description

You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources.

The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.

The aim of the project is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This analysis will allow to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. The goal is to plan a campaign for 2017 using data from 2016.

Hypotheses of the project are:-

* Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.

* Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
