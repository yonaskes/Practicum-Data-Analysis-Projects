Phone Internet Plan

Which one is a better plan?

You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

The aim of the project is to analyse data of Megaline company and to come to conclusion which of the two plans (Surf or Ultimate) brings more revenue in order to help them to adjust the advertising budjet of the company.
