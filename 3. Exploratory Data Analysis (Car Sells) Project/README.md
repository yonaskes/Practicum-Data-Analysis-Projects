What sells a car?

We're an analyst at Crankshaft List. Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on our site every day. WE need to study data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.

The purpose of this project is to determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.

The project is going to confirm the following hypotheses:

Is age has impact on the price of a vehicle?

Is mileage has influence on the price of a vehicle?

Is condition of the vehicle has impact on the price of a vehicle?

Is Advertisment has influence in the price of a vehicle?

Is color of the vehicle has influence?
